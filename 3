HDFS Federation:
       >presence of multiple namenodes  increases the horizontal scaling such that at a time atleast one namenode can be accessed
       even if there is a failure in other name node.
       >the namenode has two parts :namespace,block pool
       >namespace:it contains te metadata and blockpool contain the block management.
       >namespace and block pool combines to form a namespace volume
       >these namespace volumes are also distinct.
       >the namenodes and block pool are independent
       >but data nodes are dependent such that each datanode has data from various namenode
       >the increase in number of namenode improves the scalability,performance and isolation of namenodes.
